# ZippyDown
ZippyShare downloader using PhantomJS + selenium (Works on Windows, Linux and MAC)  
  
***I've changed the name too (It's more stylish :D)***

**ZippyDown** is a Python3 script to download files from website: **"http://zippyshare.com"** directly from your terminal, without the need for web browsers.

NOTE: Zippyshare is changing the download algorithm regularly, and to bypass this problem once for all, i'm using PhantomJS + selenium.  

## TODO LIST:  
* Batch processing mode;
* CTRL+C traps (Cleans tmp file);
* Working with exceptions.  
  
## Installing:  
You need to download PhantomJS and put in the PATH environment:  
[Windows](https://www.joecolantonio.com/2014/10/14/how-to-install-phantomjs/)  
[Linux](https://gist.github.com/julionc/7476620)  
[MAC](http://macappstore.org/phantomjs/)  
  
And you need selenium module for Python 3:  
[Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
